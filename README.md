</H3>

#### ðŸš§ Work In Progress (although the architecture and main components are ready) ðŸš§

## NotesCompose

This is a sample Android app built with Jetpack components. 
[Full version](https://github.com/AlexeyPerov/Flutter-Notes) is made with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

The purpose is simply to try and learn new technologies.

## Android client

The client project consists of two modules

`:platform` contains mostly utilities
`:app` contains the client itself

This is a single-activity application. See app_navigation.xml and main_fragment_navigation.xml for navigation details.

There are three options for data repositories: Room, Retrofit, Firestore. All of them are available for basic functionality but RoomRepository is selected by default. To change it see RepositoriesModule.

## Kotless

Kotless serverless app is used to work with Retrofit repositories.
See instructions on how to run it in [Kotless page](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotless)
